# AutomatedWasteDisposal
This is a project to automate the waste disposal system using Atmega 2560 microcontroller.<br>
In this project we made a smart bin which communicates with the robot and sends an RF signal when it is full.<br>
When two RF transmitters transmit at the same time, the data from one acts as noise to the other. Hence TDM is used to avoid the interference.<br>
